### Small code snippet examples

> Initializing the library (Using Connector Discord.JS)

```js
const { Client } = require("discord.js");
const { Shoukaku, Connectors } = require("shoukaku");
const Nodes = [
  {
    name: "Localhost",
    url: "localhost:6969",
    auth: "re_aoharu",
  },
];
const client = new Client();
const shoukaku = new Shoukaku(new Connectors.DiscordJS(client), Nodes);

// Always handle "error" events or your program may crash due to uncaught error
shoukaku.on("error", (_, error) => console.error(error));
client.login("token");

// If you want shoukaku to be available on client, then bind it to it, here is one example of it
client.shoukaku = shoukaku;
```

> Never initialize Shoukaku like this, or else she will never initialize, start shoukaku before you call `client.login()`

```js
client.on("ready", () => {
  client.shoukaku = new Shoukaku(new Connectors.DiscordJS(client), Nodes);
});
```
